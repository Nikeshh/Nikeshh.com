                <p>
                  Hey there! I&apos;m Nikeshh Vijayabaskaran, and I&apos;m all about
                  building and fixing software. With over 6 years of experience
                  leading teams as a Full Stack Engineer and 7 years of
                  freelancing under my belt, I&apos;ve developed a real knack for
                  making things work
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every software application has its own unique story, and I
                  love diving into those stories and bringing them to life.
                  Whether it&apos;s creating stunning websites or solving complex
                  problems with a team, I&apos;m always up for the challenge.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>Here&apos;s a bit more about what I do:</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Web Development:</strong> I&apos;m skilled in crafting
                  beautiful and functional websites using tools like ReactJS,
                  NodeJS, and ExpressJS. From the frontend to the backend, I&apos;ve
                  got you covered.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Database Management:</strong> Need help storing and
                  managing your data? No problem! I&apos;m experienced with databases
                  like MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, ensuring your data is
                  secure and accessible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Cloud Services:</strong> I&apos;m well-versed in cloud
                  technologies like AWS and Azure, helping businesses leverage
                  the power of the cloud to scale and grow their applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Whether it&apos;s Python,
                  Java, or C++, I&apos;m comfortable writing code in multiple
                  languages and always eager to learn more.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  But it&apos;s not just about writing code for me. I&apos;m passionate
                  about using technology to make a positive impact on the world.
                  Whether it&apos;s building tools to help non-profits or
                  contributing to open-source projects, I&apos;m always looking for
                  ways to give back.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me exploring new
                  technologies, hiking in the great outdoors, or enjoying a good
                  book. Oh, and I&apos;m a big fan of coffee ‚Äì it&apos;s the fuel that
                  keeps me going!
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  If you&apos;re looking for someone who&apos;s not only passionate about
                  technology but also committed to delivering top-notch results,
